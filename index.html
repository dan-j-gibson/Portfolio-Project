          <h3>Hey It's Dan!</h3>
          <p>My name is Dan Gibson. I am an Engineering Flex student working out of Portland, Oregon.</p>
          <p>
        Outside of work I try to do as much outside as possible. I love cycling and hiking which is ideal up here in the PNW. In the winter I spend most weekends snowboarding and spend alot of time cooking and trying new recipes with friends. </p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <div>
      <p>My whole life I have had a fascination with technology and computers. From video games to building computers with my dad I have always found fun and challenging ways to work with computers. Funny enough, it wasn't until my final semester of college when I took a random web design course that made me think coding might be the right path for me. It was the first class in years that I felt truly engaged and excited to work on. I was working late on weekend nights to finish projects and was happy to do so! After a fews of working in digital marketing and a little global pandemic, I finally decided to dive headfirst into computer engineering and enroll with Thinkful. A few weeks in and I have already learned so much and feel the excitement about learning a new skill, challenging myself, and the new possibilities that are available with a new career!
